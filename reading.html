											<h3><strong>Structure of the Test<strong></h3>
										</header>
									<p> There are three sections in the reading test. Each section contains a text (which is called a ‘reading passage’ in the exam). This might come from a magazine, journal, book or newspaper. Each section is a little more difficult than the one before and features authentic reading passages. The Academic module contains three long texts of an academic nature. The General Training module features a mixture of long and short texts of a more general nature, as well as texts related to work situations.</p>
									<p>You will be asked a total of 40 questions. In order to access how much of the reading passages you understand, the questions will usually paraphrase (use different words with the same meaning) the words that are in the text. </p>
									<section>
										<header>
											<h3><strong>Question Types</strong></h3>
										</header>
										
										<p>
									The IELTS Reading module consists of three reading passages taken from books, magazines, journals or newspapers. The passages cover academic topics from scientific to historical interests, though the material will be targeted at a general, non-specialist audience. You don’t need to have specialised knowledge of the topics, as any specialised vocabulary needed for the task will be explained in the text or in a glossary.

									<p>The first two reading passages have 13 questions each, and the last one has 14 questions. The text will include titles and sometimes captions, photos and illustrations, which can help you to grasp the general meaning of the text. If a text contains technical terms, a simple glossary is provided. The total word length of all the texts can vary between 2000 and 7500 words. At least one passage contains arguments and/or views. This is usually Section 3.</p>

											<h3><strong>General Training Reading</strong></h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											The texts are about more general topics or related to work. The General Training Reading paper has three sections, each of increasing difficulty.

											<p><strong>Section 1:</strong> contains two or three short factual texts, one of which may be composite (consisting of 6-8 short texts related by topic, e.g. hotel advertisements). Topics are relevant to everyday life in an English-speaking country.
</p>
											<p><strong>Section 2:</strong> contains two short factual texts focusing on work-related issues (e.g. applying for jobs, company policies, pay and conditions, workplace facilities, staff development and training).
</p>
											<p><strong>Section 3:</strong> contains one longer, more complex text on a topic of general interest.
</p>
											<p>You’ll be reading real passages taken fromnotices, advertisements, company handbooks, official documents, books, magazines and newspapers.

											<h3><strong>What can I do to improve my performance at the Reading test?</strong></h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											<ol>
												<li>✔ Make sure you answer the questions asked. It might help to read the questions before you read the passage.</li>
													<li>✔ Manage your time. Do not spend too much time on a question you find difficult. Answer the others and then come back to it.</li>
													<li>✔ Look at visuals and subtitles to get a general idea of what the passage is about.</li>
													<li>✔ Identify the topic sentence in each paragraph. This will give you a clue to the answers.</li>
													<li>✔ Use reading strategies such as skimming and scanning to help you find the answers. Don't worry if you do not know the meaning of every single word in the text. Try to guess the meaning of the words you don't know from the context.</li>
													<li>✔ Correct grammar and spelling are important.</li>
													<li>✔ Make sure you go through your answers to check if they are relevant to the questions asked and if the language used is correct.
